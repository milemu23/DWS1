	  <h3>Three Generations of Service</h3>
	  
	  <p><em>Munksgard Towing. <strong>In the Family Since 1932.</strong></em></p>
	  <p> It all started with Elmer Munksgard. During <abbr title="World War I">WWI</abbr>, he was a truck driver in France for the United States Army. After that he lived on a farm and was a chauffer for J.B. Moore. Then in 1932, Elmer started his own garage on 14 Franklin Street in Warren, PA. His son, Chet, grew up in the garage and was familiar with mechanics. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1939. In 1942, Elmer gave the wrecker to Crossett Trucking and joined the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Army as an instructor in Diesel Mechanics. He was discharged in 1945. Crossett then returned the wrecker back to him and he restarted the business again.</p>
	  <p> In 1947, when his wife, Alma, died he sold the garage. Then Chet and Glen Logan went into business at Pennzoil Gas Station, one of the largest garages in Warren. Chet went to Florida for a while then returned home. And then Chet started the towing business that his father had begun thirty years before.</p>
	  <p> In 1977, Chet sold the towing service and began working for the Howard Tree Company. Two years later the business was restarted again by Chet’s son, Jon. Today, the business continues as Munksgard Service in Warren, Jon and Cindy Munksgard. All Chet’s sons and grandchildren have been involved in someway or another.</p>
