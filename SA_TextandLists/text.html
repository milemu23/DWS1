		<h1><strong>The Giant Squid: <em>Architeuthis<em></strong></h1>
		<p>The <strong>giant squid</strong> (genus: <strong><em>Architeuthis</em></strong>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <strong>Architeuthidae</strong>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (43 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) for females and 10 m (33 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (46 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (6.6 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (16 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>). Claims of specimens measuring 20 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (66 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
	
	<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> (Museum of Nature and Science) of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ongasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> and  <abbr title="Ongasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
